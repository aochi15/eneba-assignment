## Quick setup

1. Create and fill out `.env.development` files for the `back-end` and `front-end` directories.
2. Run `npm install && npm run dev` in the `back-end` and `front-end` directories.
3. Create a `.env.development` file for the `database` directory and run the `Dockerfile` or use your own database and run the `init.sql` script on it.

The setup is further explained in the `README.md` file of each subfolder.
